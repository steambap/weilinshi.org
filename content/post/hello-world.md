## My new blog with hugo
I've created a new blog for myself with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Why don't you do it yourself?
Because it's stupid and time consuming.

## Why hugo?
There's a lot of options out there. Here are a few options that I looked into:  
Hexo: It's hugo's counterpart in node. I love node, but a compiled static site generator is always better due to its speed. In addition, hugo's theme is easier to customize (you just need to know how go's easy-to-learn template engine works).  
hubpress: The idea of create your blog online is great and fun. But it's not very reliable. I mean react, redux, and pouchDB and &lt;other cool web technology&gt; and great, but when you crunch them together, it's pretty heavy and unusable.
medium|Ghost|*: I want my blog visible to mainland China so they're not acceptable to my case.
