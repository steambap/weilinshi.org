My name is **Weilin**.  

I write javascript, css, and html at work. I also design web pages.  

More importantly, I love open source. 
[github](https://github.com/steambap)

I've created this blog for myself with [hugo](https://gohugo.io). It's a great static site generator.

## Why Hugo?
There's a lot of options out there. Here are a few options that I looked into:  
  
**Hexo**: 
It's Hugo's counterpart in node.js. 
I love node.js, 
but that doesn't mean that Hexo is a better choice. 
Hugo is written in go and compiled to an executable, which means it will always run faster than Hexo. 
Although I use node.js at work, Hexo can be more customizable, the whole point of using static site generator is that I don't have to code anything. 
Declare some CSS, write some articles, and be done with it. 
  
**hubpress**: 
The idea of create your blog online is great and fun. 
But it's not very reliable at the time of writing. 
React, Redux, and PouchDB and &lt;other cool web technology&gt; and great, 
but when you crunch them together, 
the page is pretty slow and unusable (I see lots of errors in console, and get a bunch of failed action).
  
**medium|Ghost|other**: I want my blog visible to mainland China so they're not acceptable.
